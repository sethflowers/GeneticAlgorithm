    A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) 
    that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), 
    discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map.

See [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map) for more information.

Genetic Algorithm

An implementation of a Genetic Algorithm.

Wikipedia

    In the computer science field of artificial intelligence, a genetic algorithm (GA) 
	is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. 
	This heuristic (also sometimes called a metaheuristic) is routinely used to 
	generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems.
