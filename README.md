    In the computer science field of artificial intelligence, a genetic algorithm (GA) 
	is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. 
	This heuristic (also sometimes called a metaheuristic) is routinely used to 
	generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems.

See [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) for more information.
